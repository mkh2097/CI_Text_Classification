Classifying an extremely large Persian news dataset by using neural network algorithms written in python.

There are two implementations here:

1- Tensorflow Keras implementation (GRU Neural Network)

2- SKLearn implementation (SGDClassifier)

The preprocessing algorithm uses opensource project HAZM,
